## APMTH 207:  Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis, Inference and Optimization

**Due Date: ** Thursday, Febrary 16th, 2017 at 11:59pm

**Instructions:**

- Upload your final answers as well as your iPython notebook containing all work to Canvas.

- Structure your notebook and your work to maximize readability.

## Problem 1: Optimization via Descent

Suppose you are building a pricing model for laying down telecom cables over a geographical region. Your model takes as input a pair of  coordinates, $(x, y)$, and contains two parameters, $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$. Given a coordinate, $(x, y)$, and model parameters, the loss in revenue corresponding to the price model at location $(x, y)$ is described by

$$
L(x, y, \lambda_1, \lambda_2) = 0.000045\lambda_2^2 y - 0.000098\lambda_1^2 x + 0.003926\lambda_1 x\exp\left\{\left(y^2 - x^2\right)\left(\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2\right)\right\}
$$

Read the data contained in `HW3_data.csv`. This is a set of coordinates configured on the curve $y^2 - x^2 = -0.1$. Given the data, find parameters $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ that minimize the net loss over the entire dataset.

### Part A
- Visually verify that for $\lambda_1 = 2.05384, \lambda_2 = 0$, the loss function $L$ is minimized for the given data.
- Implement gradient descent for minimizing $L$ for the given data, using the learning rate of 0.001.
- Implement stochastic gradient descent for minimizing $L$ for the given data, using the learning rate of 0.001.

### Part B
- Compare the average time it takes to update the parameter estimation in each iteration of the two implementations. Which method is faster? Briefly explain why this result should be expected.
- Compare the number of iterations it takes for each algorithm to obtain an estimate accurate to `1e-3` (you may wish to set a cap for maximum number of iterations). Which method converges to the optimal point in fewer iterations? Briefly explain why this result should be expected.

### Part C
Compare the performance of stochastic gradient descent for the following learning rates: 1, 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001. Based on your observations, briefly describe the effect of the choice of learning rate on the performance of the algorithm.
