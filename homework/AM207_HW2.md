## APMTH 207: Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis, Inference and Optimization

**Due Date: ** Thursday, Febrary 9th, 2017 at 11:59pm

**Instructions:**

- Upload your final answers as well as your iPython notebook containing all work to Canvas.

- Structure your notebook and your work to maximize readability.

## Problem 1: Monte Carlo Integration

Let $X$ be a random variable with distribution described by the following pdf:

$$
f_X(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{12}(x-1), &1\leq x\leq 3\\
-\frac{1}{12}(x-5), &3< x\leq 5\\
\frac{1}{6}(x-5), &5< x\leq 7\\
-\frac{1}{6}(x-9), &7< x\leq 9\\
0, &otherwise
\end{cases}
$$

Let $h$ be the following function of $X$:

$$
h(X) = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{2}\pi}\mathrm{exp}\left\{ -\frac{1}{18}\left( X - 5\right)^2\right\}
$$

Compute $\mathbb{E}[h(X)]$ via Monte Carlo simulation using the following sampling methods:
- inverse transform sampling
- rejection sampling with both uniform proposal distribution and normal proposal distribution (steroids) (with appropriately chosen parameters)
- importance sampling with both uniform proposal distribution and normal proposal distribution (with appropriately chosen parameters)

## Problem 2: Variance Reduction

### Part A

Compute the variance of each estimate of $\mathbb{E}[h(X)]$ obtained in Problem 1. Based on the discussion on sampling methods in lecture, which sampling methods, proposal distributions is expected, in principle, to resulted in lower variances? How well do your results align with these expectations?

### Part B (Stratified Sampling)

Often, a complex integral can be computed with more ease if one can break up the domain of the integral into pieces and if on each piece of the domain the integral is simplified. 

- Find a natural way to divide the domain of $X$ and express $\mathbb{E}[h(X)]$ as an ***correctly*** weighted sum of integrals over the pieces of the domain of $X$. (This constitutes the essentials of Stratified Sampling)

- Estimate each integral in the summand using rejection sampling using a normal proposal distribution (with sensibly chosen parameters). From these, estimate $\mathbb{E}[h(X)]$.

- Compute the variance of your estimate of $\mathbb{E}[h(X)]$. Compare with the variance of your previous estimate of $\mathbb{E}[h(X)]$ (in Part A, using rejection sampling, a normal proposal distribution over the entire domain of $X$).
