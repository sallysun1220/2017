## APMTH 207: Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis, Inference and Optimization

**Due Date: ** Thursday, March 9th, 2017 at 11:59pm

**Instructions:**

- Upload your final answers as well as your iPython notebook containing all work to Canvas.

- Structure your notebook and your work to maximize readability.

## Problem 1: Gibbs Sampling

Let $\mathbf{X}$ be a random variable taking values in $\mathbb{R}^2$. That is, $\mathbf{X}$ is a 2-dimensional vector. Suppose that $\mathbf{X}$ is normally distributed as follows
$$ 
\mathbf{X} \sim \mathcal{N} \left(  
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
    1  \\ 
    2  \\ 
  \end{array} 
\right],
\left[
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    4 & 1.2  \\ 
    1.2 & 4 \\ 
  \end{array} 
  \right] \right).
$$ 
That is, the pdf of the distribution of $\mathbf{X}$ is
$$
f_{\mathbf{X}}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\vert \Sigma\vert }}\mathrm{exp}\left\{ - \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{x} - \mu)^\top \Sigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x} - \mu)\right\}
$$
where $\mu = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
    1  \\ 
    2  \\ 
  \end{array} 
\right]$, $\Sigma = \left[
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    4 & 1.2  \\ 
    1.2 & 4 \\ 
  \end{array} 
  \right]$, and $\vert \cdot\vert $ is the matrix determinant operator.

In the following, we will denote the random variable corresponding to the first component of $\mathbf{X}$ by $X_1$ and the second component by $X_2$.

### Part A:
Write the Gibbs sampler for this distribution by sampling sequentially from the two conditional distributions $f_{X_1\vert X_2}, f_{X_2\vert X_1}$. Choose a thinning parameter, burn-in factor and total number of iterations that allow you to take 10000 non-autocorrelated draws. You must justify your choice of parameters. 

## Problem 2: Bayesian Inference and All That
In the competitive rubber chicken retail market, the success of a company is built on satisfying the exacting standards of a consumer base with refined and discriminating taste. In particular, customer product reviews are all important. But how should we judge the quality of a product based on customer reviews?

On Amazon, the first customer review statistic displayed for a product is the ***average rating***. The following are the main product pages for two competing rubber chicken products, manufactured by Lotus World and Toysmith respectively:


Lotus World |  Toysmith
- |  -

Clicking on the 'customer review' link on the product pages takes us to a detailed break-down of the reviews. In particular, we can now see the number of times a product is rated a given rating (between 1 and 5 stars).

In the following, we will ask you to compare these two products using the various rating statistics. Larger versions of the images are available in the data set accompanying this notebook.

Suppose that for each product, we can model the probability of the value each new rating as the following vector:
$$
\theta = [\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4, \theta_5]
$$
where $\theta_i$ is the probability that a given customer will give the product $i$ number of stars.


### Part A: Inference

- Suppose you are told that customer opinions are very polarized in the retail world of rubber chickens, that is, most reviews will be 5 stars or 1 stars (with little middle ground). Choose an appropriate Dirichlet prior for $\theta$. Recall that the Dirichlet pdf is given by:
$$
f_{\Theta}(\theta) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha)} \prod_{i=1}^k \theta_i^{\alpha_i - 1}, \quad B(\alpha) = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^k\Gamma(\alpha_i)}{\Gamma\left(\sum_{i=1}^k\alpha_i\right)},
$$
where $\theta_i \in (0, 1)$ and $\sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i = 1$, $\alpha_i > 0 $ for $i = 1, \ldots, k$.

- Write an expression for the posterior pdf, using a using a multinomial model for observed ratings. Recall that the multinomial pdf is given by:
$$
f_{\mathbf{X}\vert  \Theta}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{n!}{x_1! \ldots x_k!} \theta_1^{x_1} \ldots \theta_k^{x_k}
$$
where $n$ is the total number of trials, $\theta_i$ is the probability of event $i$ and $\sum_i \theta_i = 1$, and $x_i$ is count of outcome $i$ and $\sum_i x_i = n$. 

  **Note:** The data you will need in order to define the likelihood function should be read off the image files included in the dataset.
  

- Sample 1,000 values of $\theta$ from the *posterior distribution*.
 
- Sample 1,000 values of $x$ from the *posterior predictive distribution*.


### Part B: Ranking

- Name at least two major potential problems with using only the average customer ratings to compare products.

  (**Hint:** if product 1 has a higher average rating than product 2, can we conclude that product 1 is better liked? If product 1 and product 2 have the same average rating, can we conclude that they are equally good?)
  

- Using the samples from your *posterior distribution*, determine which rubber chicken product is superior. Justify your conclusion with sample statistics.

- Using the samples from your *posterior predictive distribution*, determine which rubber chicken product is superior. Justify your conclusion with sample statistics.

- Finally, which rubber chicken product is superior?

  (**Note:** we're not looking for "the correct answer" here, any sound decision based on a statistically correct interpretation of your model will be fine)
